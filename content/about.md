Hello! My name is Pascal and I am a recent Computer Science graduate who now works as a software developer with a focus on 3D visualization.
I am passionate about all things game development and computer graphics.
Sometimes, I try my hand at writing accessible explainers about the topics I am interested in and publish them on this page.
I'm always open to feedback and questions!
