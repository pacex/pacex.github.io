Hello! My name is Pascal and I am a recent Computer Science graduate who now works as a researcher in the field of visual computing.
Over the years I have become very passionate about rendering, computer graphics and, more recently, the field's intersection with machine learning.
On this page, I like to do my best at writing approachable articles about topics I am interested in.

Contact me by sending an e-mail to [contact@pascalwalloner.com](mailto:contact@pascalwalloner.com).
